          <p>
          <p>I am a second generation Korean American born in Hawaii and raised in Washington State.</p>
          <p>I graduated from the University of Washington with a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Health 
          and a Minor in Chemistry. My first job was at Amazon as a Environmental Health Specialist. I then attended 
          a year long program within Amazon called Amazon Technical Academy to become a Software Development Engineer. 
          I worked as a SDE for the Amazon Care team, Amazonâ€™s virtual healthcare service, for backend development. 
          After my 4 years at Amazon, I decided to pivot my career into front end development and UI/UX design. 
          I am currently a UX Designer at DocAI, a healthcare AI start up.</p>
          <p>Outside of work I enjoy powerlifting, training Brazilian jiu jitsu, teaching fitness classes, and personal training. 
          I also love traveling abroad and spending time with my miniature schnauzer.</p>
